🎮 Guess the Number – Simple Console Game

A small and playful number-guessing game. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it.
After each attempt, the game provides feedback: too high, too low, or correct.
The logic is implemented using classic control structures (if/else), loops, and basic variables and data types.

Players can also quit the game at any time by typing exit.

A lightweight project to practice fundamental programming concepts in a fun way.
